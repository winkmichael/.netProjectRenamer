# .netProjectRenamer

This will rename any .net project and all the recursive references

Usage 

python3 projectRename.py -d "originalProjectDirectory" -f "originalProjectDirectory" -r "newProjectName"

Notes: 
- the second reference to originalProjectDirectory is the project name
- this program will make a new directory
- test with .net xamarin and .net maui project

Works automatic, and certainly faster than following the horrible guides out there. Its basically a renaming script.
